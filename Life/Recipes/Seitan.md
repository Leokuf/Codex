# Recipe for Seitan

**Wheat Loaf**
* 2 cups vital wheat gluten
* 6 tbsp nutritional yeast

* 1/2 cup Bragg's Liquid aminos
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 3 tbsp garlic

**Broth**
* 8 cups vegetable broth

## Steps
1. In a large mixing pot, stir together all ingredients listed in the Wheat Loaf. Over ten minutes or so, knead the ball of dough until it feels rubbery to the touch. Cut the loaf 12 equal pieces. Flatten each piece until it is about 1/2 inch thick.
2. Bring all ingredients listed in the Broth to a boil. Once at a rolling boil, add each of the twelve pieces of Seitan carefully. Cover pot, and bring to a boil. Reduce to low heat and simmer over the course of an hour, turning the Seitan pieces occassionally. Once patties are firm, remove the pot from the oven and allow patties to cool in broth for 15-20 minutes minutes.
